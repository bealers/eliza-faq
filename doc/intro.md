Make a FAQ system for [ElizaOS](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/) loaded with FAQ data from its own Discord.

## Comms from Jin (via X DMs):
- `plan is [this discord bot](https://needle.gg) for dedicated "ask AI" channel to keep channel list clean. Every question can spawn a new thread.`
- `look at FAQ [in this section](https://hackmd.io/@XR/elizaos-rpgf/), need to consolidate the questions / answers first, made a new branch but think they're moving docs to a new repo so gunna spin that up today`
- `I think good goal / hackathon project is making an Eliza loaded with this data`

## Direction

- [x] data ready to analyse 
- [ ] analysis & manual curaration
- [ ] consider other 3rd party discord options
- [ ] suss out how Agent Scarlett works
- [ ] Check out new ElizaOS docs repo structure

## Questions

- What is the workflow for new Qs?
    - How to validate answers to ensure actually correct?
    - how does the bot learn? 
- can we load up with unanswered questions
- can we give out bounties for answering?
