Scratch

**14 Feb**
- Created [new install guide](https://hackmd.io/@bealers/BJNcWxFYJl/%2FMgwj6n1kSMyPxnaLpcbKzw) from scratch, no ai.
- That's already been pulled
- [Created summary](https://hackmd.io/@bealers/BJNcWxFYJl/%2F505xZ6UpSw2qOKw4f-5O0g) of Nader Dabit's recent ElisaOS plugin from scratch YT video


**12 Feb**

- [x] produce quick win popular dev FAQ in format suitible for docs site
- [ ] investigate default Eliza RAG options

-Considering a database, outputting as text for docs still np, but if we want to add 'solved by' and tipping etc, then a db might be useful. a little crud ui backend would be nice if so

-Claude did a good job of grouping the most popular questions but 
noticing that a lot of the sumamrised answers from Jin's script are pretty lame. Before we manually intervene we're going to need a second pass of the quetions to see if armed with the codebase's context, we can get claude to provide relevant code examples to support the answers.

- Figured out HackMD, created a book
- [burner repo](https://github.com/bealers/eliza-faq) created populated with various FAQs from Jin's page, ready for scripting/analysis
- installed [Needle](https://needle.gg) on personal discord
    - bearish the UI
    - can't see how to import ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkeElVKYye.png)
- ditto [Q&A](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/866819673906348063)
some sensilbe workflow, but clunky/not suitible 
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sk0GZIKYJl.png)
