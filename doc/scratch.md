**11 Feb**

- Figured out HackMD, created a book
- [burner repo](https://github.com/bealers/eliza-faq) created populated with various FAQs from Jin's page, ready for scripting/analysis
- installed [Needle](needle.gg) on personal discord
    - bearish the UI
    - can't see how to import ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkeElVKYye.png)
- ditto [Q&A](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/866819673906348063)
some sensilbe workflow, but clunky/not suitible

- tried a few more, starting to feel like we need a custom bot
- found some repos on Github, nothing jumped out
- **need to confirm workflow**
