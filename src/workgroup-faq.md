### What are the best dates/timing for ElizaCon?
Most discussions converged on early May 2025 as optimal timing to avoid conflicts with other major crypto conferences while allowing adequate planning time. The event would likely span 3-4 days including hackathon components.

### Should ElizaCon be in San Francisco or Los Angeles? 
San Francisco emerged as a leading choice due to proximity to AI companies, tech talent, and VC networks, despite higher costs. The Exploratorium was discussed as a potential venue, though venue costs were similar between SF and LA.

### What format should ElizaCon follow?
The consensus was to create a hybrid format combining traditional keynotes with an "unconference" style featuring interactive sessions, an "Agent Bazaar" for demos, and hackathon components. This would balance structured content with collaborative activities.

### How can we handle sponsorships and funding?
The strategy is to secure sponsorships to cover most costs (estimated $500k-750k), leveraging relationships with tech companies, VCs, and crypto projects. Additional revenue would come from ticket sales if needed.

### Should ElizaCon coincide with other crypto events?
While initially considered, the preference shifted toward a standalone event to avoid competing for attention, though timing near (but not overlapping with) major events like ETH Denver or Solana events was discussed for potential synergies.

### How can we make the event interactive and engaging?
Plans include creating an "Agent Bazaar" for interactive demos, incorporating AI/agent experiences throughout, enabling virtual participation through DAO-Town broadcasts, and facilitating meaningful networking opportunities through smaller breakout sessions.

### What production support is needed?
The group discussed hiring a professional production company (with a typical 15% agency fee) and sending out RFPs to multiple agencies. Experience with large tech conferences was deemed important.

### What is a launchpad and is it under development?
Yes, a launchpad is actively under development. It includes plans for a decentralized hosting layer that could create synergies between EigenLayer and Eliza.

### How can I join specific working groups (tokenomics, EVM, etc.)?
Express interest in the relevant channel and provide background experience. Most working groups are open to new members who can contribute expertise or are willing to learn and participate actively.

### What's the current state of hosting platforms for Eliza?
Several hosting platforms are available including Vvaifus and Mee.fun. The focus is on developing sustainable swarm infrastructure that operates on English.

### How are the working groups structured?
Working groups are organized around specific focus areas (tokenomics, platform, trust, etc.) with dedicated channels and leadership. Members can participate in multiple groups based on their interests and expertise.

### How can I implement or create an Eliza AI agent?
You'll need to understand the Eliza framework, work with the available plugins, and potentially integrate with NFT platforms depending on your use case. The specific implementation details vary based on requirements.

### What is the whitepaper's scope and format?
The whitepaper is written in LaTeX and primarily covers the current version (v1) of Eliza, with frameworks being developed for benchmarking and technical specifications.

### How can I contribute to the trust/reputation systems?
The trust workgroup focuses on developing reputation systems and incentive mechanisms. Contributors can help with research, implementation, and testing of various trust models.

### How do you handle governance in the working groups?
The groups are exploring a hybrid model combining decentralized identity, Zealy for XP/points tracking, and AI agents for automation. The goal is to minimize human intervention while maintaining transparency.

### What development tools/frameworks are being used?
Most groups use GitHub for code collaboration, LaTeX for documentation, and various specialized tools depending on their focus area (e.g., Obsidian for knowledge management, specific blockchain development tools).

### How can I start a new working group?
Propose the idea in #workgroups-general, outline the goals and scope, and gather interested contributors. New working groups like EVM and 3D-AI have been created based on community interest and need.

### What's the relationship between different working groups?
Working groups often collaborate and share resources - for example, the platform group works with trust/security groups, while the whitepaper group coordinates with all teams to document developments.

### How are decisions made within working groups?
Groups typically operate with a mix of leadership guidance and community input. Major decisions often involve discussion in the relevant channels and coordination with other affected groups.

### What's the process for contributing to working group projects?
Join the relevant channel, introduce yourself and your expertise, review existing documentation and discussions, and look for areas where you can contribute. Many groups have specific onboarding documents and processes.

### How are resources allocated between working groups?
Groups can access shared resources and may receive grants or funding based on their needs and objectives. Sponsorships and community support are also common funding mechanisms.

### What documentation is required for working group activities?
Groups maintain various forms of documentation including technical specifications, meeting notes, progress reports, and contribution guidelines. The format varies by group but emphasizes transparency and accessibility.


### How do swarms and agents interact across working groups?
Swarms are being developed to enable agent-to-agent communication across different "departments" of ai16z, with shared databases and reliable communication protocols being established.

### What's the role of plugins in the ecosystem?
Plugins are a key focus across multiple working groups, with efforts to create both free and paid options that allow users to launch agents with or without coding skills. Different groups are developing plugins for specific use cases (EVM chains, TEE integration, etc.).

### How is AI integrated into the governance structure?
AI agents are being developed to help automate various DAO functions while maintaining decentralization. This includes handling event management, trust systems, and automated redistribution processes.

### What are the requirements for leadership roles in working groups?
Leaders typically need to demonstrate both technical expertise and community involvement. There are specific onboarding documents and codes of conduct for project managers and group leaders.

### How are security and trust maintained across working groups?
The trust workgroup coordinates with other groups to implement security measures, including TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) integration, decentralized identity verification, and reputation systems.

### What's the relationship between working groups and ElizaCon planning?
Many working groups are contributing to ElizaCon planning, with different groups responsible for various aspects like technical demonstrations, workshops, and the "Agent Bazaar" concept.

### How are technical standards maintained across working groups?
There's an emphasis on standardization of data structures, documentation formats, and development practices across groups, with v2 of the platform expected to introduce more uniform data structures.
