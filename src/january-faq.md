## Q1: hi guys, im trying to have multiple characteres running, how does secrets works ? shoulh I copy paste .env config that are customized for each character ? like TWITTER_USERNAME=xxxxx TWITTER_PASSWORD=xxxx etc. ?
**Asked by:** Pouncer

**Answer:** i haven't tried to run multiple agent in one command but what will i do , for quick test , just create a project for each agent then with that you can change all the settings for each agent project and you can both run it, in a separate terminal, because in cloud its the samething you will create a docker image one for each agent, but maybe there's a better way , i will search if there's a way to run multiple agent in one project and if that is possible
